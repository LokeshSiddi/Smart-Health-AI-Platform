Smart Health AI Platform ü©∫ü§ñ
=============================

A cutting-edge, microservices-based platform that transforms wearable device data into personalized, AI-driven health insights. This project is built using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **Spring Cloud** to create a scalable and resilient system.

‚ú® Overview
----------

The **Smart Health AI Platform** is an intelligent system designed for the modern health-conscious individual. It seamlessly collects vital metrics from smartwatches, processes this data through a robust, event-driven architecture, and leverages the power of the **Gemini 2.0 Flash API** to deliver actionable, real-time health advice.

From personalized diet plans to critical safety alerts based on your vitals, our platform acts as your personal health companion.

üèóÔ∏è Architecture
----------------

The platform is built on a modern **Microservices Architecture** using the **Spring Cloud** ecosystem. This design decouples services, allowing for independent scaling and deployment, which enhances the system's overall resilience and flexibility.

*   **Config Server**: A centralized service for managing the external configuration for all microservices.
    
*   **Eureka Server**: Provides service discovery, allowing services to find and communicate with each other dynamically.
    
*   **API Gateway**: A single entry point for all client requests. It routes requests to the appropriate microservice and handles cross-cutting concerns like security and rate limiting.
    
*   **User Service**: Manages user profiles, authentication, and personal data.
    
*   **Activity Service**: Responsible for ingesting and processing fitness data from wearable devices.
    
*   **AI Service**: Integrates with the Google Gemini API to generate personalized health insights, tips, and recommendations.
